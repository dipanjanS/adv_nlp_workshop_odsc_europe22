![](https://i.imgur.com/t72tXFy.png)


## Abstract: 

Being specialized in domains like computer vision and natural language processing is no longer a luxury but a necessity which is expected of any data scientist in todayâ€™s fast-paced world! With a hands-on and interactive approach, we will understand essential concepts in NLP along with extensive hands-on examples to master state-of-the-art tools, techniques and methodologies for actually applying NLP to solve real-world problems. We will specifically be focusing on deep learning and deep transfer learning models to learn and solve popular tasks using NLP including NER, Classification, Search / Information Retrieval, Summarization, Classification, Language Translation, Q&A systems.

<br/>

## Session Outline

### Module 1: NLP Applications with Traditional Deep Learning
We will look at several popular applications of NLP in this module and go through hands-on examples. This includes word embeddings, text classification and sentiment analysis, sequential deep learning models


__Key Focus Areas: Embeddings, Similarity \ Information Retrieval, Classification & Sentiment Analysis (deep learning models)__


<br/>

### Module 2: NLP Applications with Deep Transfer Learning
We will dive into some of the latest and best advancements which have happened in the last few years in the world of NLP, thanks to deep transfer learning. We will cover a deep conceptual understanding of the transformer architecture and look at some hands-on examples of text classification and multi-task NLP using transformers where we look at solving NER, Q&A, sentiment analysis, summarization, translation using effective constructs like the transformers pipeline and even teach you how you can fine-tune some of these models on custom data.

__Key Focus Areas: Search with Contextual Transformer Embeddings vs. Word Embeddings, Text Classification, Multi-task NLP with transformers (sentiment analysis, NER, text generation, summarization, question-answering, translation). Fine-tuning\training transformers (tips \ guidelines) with examples e.g Language Translation, Sentiment Analysis, Summarization__
